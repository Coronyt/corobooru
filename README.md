# corobooru

`corobooru` is a web app for creating personal imageboards

Since mid-2025, development of `corobooru` has been on hiatus

## Features
- Register with a valid email address and get your own imageboard
- Intuitively create dynamic collections from your images by selecting tags
- Share any collection of images from your personal board by simply copying the URL
- Viewers are not required to register; anyone with the URL can view your board
- No unnecessary feature-bloat means no social media features or integration

## Tech stack
- `corobooru` is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack
- An Express.js API on the back-end receives requests from a React front-end
- The back-end (Node.js/Express) communicates with a MongoDB database hosted on an AWS server
